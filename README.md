Thought I'd try and do this in Blazor, since I'd not messed with it before.

This allows for selecting both the starting direction of your spiral, as well as if it's moving clockwise or counter-clockwise.

No explicit error handling, although the Blazor bindings should only attempt to generate a new spiral if required fields are all populated.
